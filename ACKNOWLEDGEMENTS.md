# Digital Preservation the Hard Way
###Open Repositories 2015 Poster Session
###June 9, 2015

##Acknowledgements

This poster really would not have been possible without the help of these fine people:

###Sam Ottenhoff, Longsight
Sam has posted a very helpful collection of DSpace-related utility scripts:

* https://github.com/ottenhoff/dspace-utils

Without his _move-structure.php_ script, working out the best order of restoring missing
data via SQL INSERT statements would have involved lots of trial and error. When I most
needed help, Sam's script provided that help. And I will be forever in his debt.

###Kathleen Schweitzberger, University of Missouri - Kansas City
Former chair of the committee that provides direction and guidance for my group, community
administrator for her campus' top level community in MOspace (the institutional repository
of the University of Missouri). She provided the inspiration for this poster, and has
been a good sport through much kidding. I'm glad we found the undelete button.

###Mark Wood, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis
Fellow committer and release team member, seemingly *always* available for a chat in IRC, 
and always willing to pitch in, help wrestle a bug, or, in this case, provide much-needed
editorial review of this poster copy.
